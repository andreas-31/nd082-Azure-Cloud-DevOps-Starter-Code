    I opened Postman then I created a Lesson4 collection. Next I went to Add Request.
    I added a Get All Users request
        I made sure it was a GET request
        Pasted in the link
        Set a parameter of page with a value of 1
    I added a Create User request
        I made sure it was a POST request
        Pasted in the link
        Went to the Body tab, then selected “raw”
        Pasted in the JSON, and filled in the fields
        After I received the response I copied the _id
    I added a Get by UserId request
        I made sure it was a GET request
        Pasted in the link, and added the _id from the create
        Sent the request, and my user was returned.
